# Skincare in Your Thirties

Something shifted in my skin around 28. The same products that worked in my twenties suddenly weren't cutting it. Fine lines appeared. Dullness crept in. And don't get me started on adult acne.

After much research (and a very expensive dermatologist visit), I finally have a routine that works.

## The Basics: What Your Skin Needs Now

In our thirties, three things change:

1. **Cell turnover slows down** — Why we need exfoliation
2. **Collagen production decreases** — Why we need retinoids
3. **Skin barrier weakens** — Why we need hydration and protection

## My Morning Routine

### Step 1: Gentle Cleanser

I use CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser. Nothing fancy, but it doesn't strip my skin.

### Step 2: Vitamin C Serum

This is my anti-aging MVP. It brightens, protects against environmental damage, and helps with dark spots. I use Skinceuticals C E Ferulic (a splurge) or Timeless Vitamin C (budget-friendly).

### Step 3: Hyaluronic Acid

A few drops of The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid on damp skin. This plumps and hydrates without heaviness.

### Step 4: Moisturizer

Something lightweight with SPF for daytime. I love the La Roche-Posay Double Repair Face Moisturizer.

### Step 5: Sunscreen (Non-Negotiable)

If you do nothing else, do this. I wear SPF 50 every single day, rain or shine. Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen is my holy grail.

## My Evening Routine

### Step 1: Double Cleanse

Oil cleanser first (to remove sunscreen and makeup), then a gentle water-based cleanser.

### Step 2: Retinol

Three nights a week, I use a prescription-strength retinoid. For beginners, start with The Ordinary Retinol 0.5%.

**Important**: Start slowly (once a week) and build up. Your skin will purge initially—this is normal.

### Step 3: Hydrating Serum

On non-retinol nights, I use a hydrating serum like Drunk Elephant's B-Hydra.

### Step 4: Eye Cream

Yes, I finally caved. A good eye cream (I use SkinCeuticals A.G.E. Eye Complex) helps with the fine lines and dark circles that come with adulting.

### Step 5: Night Cream

Something rich and restorative. CeraVe Night Cream or La Mer if I'm feeling fancy.

## The Products That Made the Biggest Difference

1. **Retinol** — Nothing else comes close for fine lines and texture
2. **Vitamin C** — Visible brightness in weeks
3. **SPF** — Prevention > Treatment
4. **Proper cleansing** — Double cleansing was a game-changer

## What I Stopped Doing

- **Using too many actives** — Less is more
- **Skipping moisturizer** — Even oily skin needs hydration
- **Touching my face** — Harder than it sounds
- **Switching products constantly** — Give things time to work (8-12 weeks)

## In-Office Treatments

Once or twice a year, I invest in:

- **Chemical peels** — For texture and brightness
- **Microneedling** — For collagen stimulation
- **Light therapy** — For overall skin health

## The Lifestyle Factors

Skincare products can only do so much. I've noticed the biggest improvements from:

- Sleeping 7-8 hours consistently
- Drinking enough water
- Limiting alcohol and sugar
- Managing stress (easier said than done)
