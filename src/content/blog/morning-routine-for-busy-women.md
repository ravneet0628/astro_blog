# My Realistic Morning Routine

I've tried every trendy morning routine out there—cold plunges, hour-long meditations, green juice cleanses. Most lasted about three days. Here's what actually stuck.

## The Routine That Changed Everything

**5:30 AM** — Wake up (no snooze)

The key was moving my phone charger across the room. Now I *have* to get up to turn off the alarm.

**5:35 AM** — Hydrate + move

A large glass of water with lemon, then 10 minutes of stretching or yoga. Nothing intense—just waking up my body.

**5:45 AM** — Coffee ritual

This is non-negotiable. I grind beans, use my French press, and actually sit down to drink it. No scrolling.

**6:00 AM** — Brain dump journaling

Three pages of stream-of-consciousness writing. Not goals, not gratitude—just whatever's in my head. This practice alone has reduced my anxiety significantly.

**6:20 AM** — Plan the day

I review my calendar and write down my top 3 priorities. Not 10 things—three.

**6:30 AM** — Get ready

Shower, skincare, getting dressed. Having a capsule wardrobe makes this much faster.

**7:15 AM** — Out the door (or at my desk)

With time to spare before the world starts demanding things from me.

## Why This Works (When Others Didn't)

### It's Flexible

If I sleep poorly, I skip the stretching. If I'm running late, the journaling gets shorter. The framework matters more than perfection.

### It's Enjoyable

I actually look forward to this time. There's no suffering involved—no ice baths or forcing myself to exercise when I don't want to.

### It's Mine

Before 7 AM, I haven't checked email, social media, or news. This time belongs entirely to me.

## What I've Stopped Doing

- **Checking my phone first thing** — This was the hardest habit to break but the most impactful
- **Setting unrealistic goals** — "I'll wake up at 4 AM and run 5 miles" was never going to happen
- **Feeling guilty about coffee** — It brings me joy. The end.
- **Comparing my routine to influencers** — Their routines are content, not reality

## The Unexpected Benefits

Since starting this routine six months ago:

- My anxiety has decreased noticeably
- I'm more focused at work
- I make better decisions (no more reactive choices)
- I feel in control of my day rather than controlled by it

## Tips for Building Your Own Routine

1. **Start with one thing** — Don't overhaul your entire morning at once
2. **Anchor to existing habits** — Link new habits to things you already do
3. **Prepare the night before** — Set out clothes, prep the coffee maker
4. **Protect this time fiercely** — Early meetings and late nights will try to steal it
5. **Give it 30 days** — That's how long it takes to feel natural
