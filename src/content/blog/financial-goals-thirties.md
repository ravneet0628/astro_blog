# Money in Your 30s

I'll be honest: my twenties were a financial mess. I made decent money but had nothing to show for it. Turning 30 was my wake-up call to get serious about building wealth.

## Where I Started

At 30, I had:
- A 401(k) I barely understood
- $8,000 in credit card debt
- Maybe $2,000 in savings
- Zero investments outside of retirement

Not exactly where I wanted to be.

## The Financial Goals That Transformed Everything

### 1. Build a Proper Emergency Fund

**Goal**: 6 months of expenses in a high-yield savings account

This was my first priority. Before investing, before anything else, I needed a safety net. I automated $500/month until I hit my target.

**Why it matters**: When I lost my job unexpectedly last year, this fund let me take my time finding the right next role instead of panicking into the first offer.

### 2. Eliminate High-Interest Debt

**Strategy**: Avalanche method (highest interest first)

I attacked my credit card debt aggressively, throwing every extra dollar at it. It took 18 months, but the freedom of being debt-free was worth every sacrifice.

### 3. Max Out Retirement Contributions

**Goal**: Max out 401(k) and open a Roth IRA

The power of compound interest means every dollar invested in your thirties works harder than dollars invested in your forties. I now max out my 401(k) ($23,000 in 2025) and contribute to a Roth IRA.

### 4. Start Investing Outside Retirement

**Strategy**: Index funds and automatic contributions

I opened a brokerage account with Vanguard and set up automatic monthly investments into low-cost index funds. I don't try to time the market or pick individual stocks.

### 5. Know My Numbers

Every month, I track:
- Net worth
- Spending by category
- Savings rate
- Investment returns

What gets measured gets managed.

## The Money Mindset Shifts

### From Scarcity to Abundance

I stopped saying "I can't afford that" and started asking "How can I afford that?" This shift opened up creative thinking about earning and saving.

### From Fear to Education

Investing used to terrify me. Now I understand that staying in cash is the real risk (hello, inflation). I educated myself through books, podcasts, and financial advisors.

### From Keeping Up to Intentional Spending

I stopped comparing my lifestyle to others and started spending on what truly matters to me. I might not have the newest car, but I can afford solo trips to Portugal.

## Practical Steps to Get Started

1. **Know where your money goes** — Track for one month, no judgment
2. **Automate everything** — Savings, investments, bill payments
3. **Increase your income** — Ask for raises, start side projects
4. **Learn about investing** — Start with "The Simple Path to Wealth" by JL Collins
5. **Find your community** — Financial literacy shouldn't be taboo

## The Numbers That Matter at 30

- **Emergency fund**: 3-6 months expenses
- **Retirement savings**: 1x your annual salary by 30, 3x by 40
- **Savings rate**: Aim for 20% of income
- **Debt-to-income**: Below 35%
