# Dating After 30

When I turned 30 and was still single, I felt a small wave of panic. Society had taught me I was supposed to have it all figured out by now. But here's what actually happened: dating got *better*.

## Why Dating Is Different Now

### I Know What I Want

In my twenties, I dated potential. "He'll change." "Maybe I can learn to love hiking." "His ambition is attractive even if he has no time for me."

Now? I know my non-negotiables:

- Emotional availability (not "busy" all the time)
- Shared values around family, money, and lifestyle
- Someone who's done their own work
- Genuine kindness, not performative niceness

### I Trust My Instincts

The red flags I used to ignore? I see them clearly now. That feeling in my gut that something's off? I listen to it. The need to convince myself someone is right for me? A clear sign they're not.

### I'm Not Afraid to Walk Away

My time is valuable. If a date isn't going well, I don't force it. If someone shows me who they are, I believe them the first time.

## What I've Learned About Modern Dating

### Apps Are a Tool, Not the Enemy

Yes, dating apps can be exhausting. But I've also met genuinely wonderful people through them. My approach:

- Limit swiping to 15 minutes a day
- Focus on one app at a time
- Take breaks when needed
- Meet in person quickly—texting chemistry means nothing

### First Dates Should Be Low-Pressure

Coffee or drinks. One hour max. This takes the pressure off both people and makes it easy to extend if it's going well—or leave if it's not.

### The "Spark" Is Overrated

I used to chase butterflies and instant chemistry. Now I value consistency, reliability, and feeling safe. The best relationships I've seen grew from genuine friendship, not fireworks.

## The Mindset Shift That Changed Everything

I stopped approaching dates as auditions where I needed to impress. Instead, I started asking myself: *Do I even like this person?*

This simple shift transformed dating from anxiety-inducing to actually enjoyable.

## Questions I Ask Now

Instead of the usual small talk, I've started asking:

- "What's something you're really proud of?"
- "What does a perfect Sunday look like for you?"
- "What are you looking for in a relationship right now?"
- "How do you handle conflict?"

You'd be surprised how much these reveal about compatibility.

## Dealing With Unsolicited Opinions

"You're so picky." "Your standards are too high." "Don't you want a family?"

I've learned to smile and change the subject. My timeline is mine. My standards protect my peace. And honestly? I'd rather be single than settle.

## What I Want Now

A partnership that adds to my already full life. Someone to share adventures with, grow alongside, and build something meaningful together. Not out of need, but out of genuine wanting.
