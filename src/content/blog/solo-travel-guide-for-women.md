# Solo Travel in Your 30s

Last year, I booked a solo trip to Portugal with nothing but a backpack and a loose itinerary. It was simultaneously the most terrifying and liberating thing I've ever done.

## Why Solo Travel Matters

There's a unique kind of growth that happens when you're completely alone in a foreign place. No one to defer to, no compromises on what to eat or where to go. Just you and your instincts.

## My Portugal Itinerary

### Lisbon (4 days)

The city of seven hills stole my heart. I spent my days:

- Getting lost in Alfama's winding streets
- Eating pastéis de nata at Manteigaria
- Taking the iconic Tram 28
- Watching sunset from Miradouro da Senhora do Monte

### Sintra (Day trip)

The fairytale palaces were worth every euro. Pro tip: book Pena Palace tickets online to skip the line.

### Porto (3 days)

- Wine tasting in the Douro Valley
- Crossing the Dom Luís I Bridge at golden hour
- Browsing Livraria Lello (arrive early!)
- Simply sitting by the river with a glass of port

## Practical Tips for Solo Female Travelers

### Safety First

- Share your itinerary with someone at home
- Keep digital copies of important documents
- Trust your gut—if something feels off, leave
- Book accommodations with good reviews from solo female travelers

### Staying Connected

- Get a local SIM card or eSIM
- Download offline maps
- Learn basic phrases in the local language
- Join walking tours to meet other travelers

### The Art of Dining Alone

This was my biggest fear. My strategies:

- Bring a book or journal
- Sit at the bar where conversation is easier
- Lunch solo is easier than dinner (start there)
- Embrace the people-watching opportunity

## What Solo Travel Taught Me

### 1. I'm More Capable Than I Thought

Navigating public transit in a foreign language, handling unexpected situations, making decisions confidently—I can do hard things.

### 2. My Own Company Is Enough

The loneliness I feared never really came. Instead, I discovered I actually enjoy being with myself.

### 3. Strangers Can Be Kind

From the elderly woman who helped me find the right metro line to the shopkeeper who drew me a map to a hidden viewpoint—people are generally good.

### 4. Plans Are Overrated

Some of my best experiences were completely unplanned. The secret garden I stumbled upon, the local festival I accidentally joined.

## My Next Solo Adventure

I've already booked my next trip: Japan in cherry blossom season. The planning has begun, and I couldn't be more excited.
