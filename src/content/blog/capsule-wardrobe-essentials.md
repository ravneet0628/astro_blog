# Building a Capsule Wardrobe

After years of closet chaos and "I have nothing to wear" meltdowns, I finally embraced the capsule wardrobe concept. Here's how 30 carefully chosen pieces transformed my relationship with getting dressed.

## Why a Capsule Wardrobe?

The average woman wears only 20% of her closet regularly. The rest? Impulse buys, aspirational purchases, and clothes that don't fit quite right. A capsule wardrobe eliminates decision fatigue and ensures you love everything you own.

## My 30-Piece Foundation

### Tops (10 pieces)

1.  White button-down shirt
    
2.  Cream silk blouse
    
3.  Black fitted turtleneck
    
4.  Navy striped Breton top
    
5.  White basic tee (I have 3)
    
6.  Black v-neck sweater
    
7.  Camel cashmere cardigan
    
8.  Chambray shirt
    

### Bottoms (7 pieces)

1.  Dark wash straight-leg jeans
    
2.  Black high-waisted trousers
    
3.  Cream wide-leg pants
    
4.  Black pencil skirt
    
5.  Denim midi skirt
    
6.  Navy tailored shorts
    
7.  Camel wool trousers
    

### Dresses (4 pieces)

1.  Black wrap dress
    
2.  Navy midi dress
    
3.  White linen sundress
    
4.  Floral print day dress
    

### Outerwear (4 pieces)

1.  Camel wool coat
    
2.  Black leather jacket
    
3.  Navy blazer
    
4.  Denim jacket
    

### Shoes (5 pieces)

1.  White leather sneakers
    
2.  Black ankle boots
    
3.  Nude pointed-toe heels
    
4.  Brown leather loafers
    
5.  Black strappy sandals
    

## The Rules I Follow

### 1\. The One-In-One-Out Rule

Before buying anything new, something must leave. This keeps the capsule tight and intentional.

### 2\. The Cost-Per-Wear Calculation

I divide the price by how many times I'll realistically wear it. A $200 blazer worn 100 times = $2 per wear. Worth it.

### 3\. The 24-Hour Rule

For any purchase over $50, I wait 24 hours. If I'm still thinking about it, it might be worth buying.

## Building Your Own Capsule

Start by:

1.  **Audit your current closet** — What do you actually wear?
    
2.  **Define your lifestyle** — Work from home? Office job? Active lifestyle?
    
3.  **Choose your color palette** — Mine is neutrals with navy as my accent
    
4.  **Invest in basics** — Quality over quantity
    
5.  **Add personality pieces** — Accessories and statement items
